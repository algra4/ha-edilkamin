# Testing Guide

This guide explains how to set up the testing environment and run tests for the Edilkamin Home Assistant integration.

## Prerequisites

### Installing uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager and resolver. Install it using one of the following methods:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

Install all dependencies declared in pyproject.toml, the dev dependency-group is installed by default:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Run tests with verbose output

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

### Run a specific test file

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_coordinator_safety.py
```

Note: The repository no longer uses requirements*.txt files. Runtime dependencies are installed by Home Assistant from custom_components/edilkamin/manifest.json. Development and test dependencies are defined in pyproject.toml and managed via uv.
